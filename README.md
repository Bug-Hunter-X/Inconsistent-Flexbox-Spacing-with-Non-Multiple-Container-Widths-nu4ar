# Inconsistent Flexbox Spacing Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to flexbox spacing inconsistencies in certain scenarios.  The bug manifests when the width of a flex container is not an exact multiple of the combined width of its flex items, particularly when using `justify-content: space-around`.  This often results in unequal spacing between items, leading to visual inconsistencies across different browsers and screen sizes.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a solution to mitigate this behavior.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` (you will need to create a simple HTML file to test this CSS). 
3. Observe the spacing between the flex items. Note the inconsistencies depending on your browser's width and screen resolution.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.css` uses a more robust approach to achieve consistent spacing, regardless of the container width.
