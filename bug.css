The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}
```

This code is intended to distribute three `.item` elements evenly within a `.container` using `flexbox`. However, in some cases, the last element might experience unexpected spacing or alignment issues, particularly if the container width is not a multiple of the items' total width. This can lead to visual inconsistencies across different browsers or screen sizes.
