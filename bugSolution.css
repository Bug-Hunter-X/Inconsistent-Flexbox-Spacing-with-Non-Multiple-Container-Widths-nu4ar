To mitigate this issue, consider using `justify-content: space-between` or `justify-content: space-evenly` instead of `space-around`, depending on the desired spacing behavior. For precise control over item spacing, you can utilize the `gap` property, or adjust the margin/padding of individual items.  

Here's an example using the `gap` property:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  gap: 20px; /* Adjust the gap as needed */
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}
```

This ensures consistent spacing regardless of the container's width.  For more complex layouts, more finely tuned margin/padding adjustments might be required.
